### PathPattern matches URL paths rules

-   `?` — matches one character
-   `-` — matches zero or more characters within a path segment
-   `**` — matches zero or more path segments until the end of the path
-   `{spring}` — matches a path segment and captures it as a variable named "spring"
-   `{spring:[a-z]+}` — matches the regexp [a-z]+ as a path variable named "spring"
-   `{_spring}` — matches zero or more path segments until the end of the path and captures it as a variable named "spring"

### Examples

-   `/pages/t?st.html` — matches /pages/test.html but also /pages/tast.html but not /pages/toast.html
-   `/resources/_.png` — matches all .png files in the resources directory
-   `/resources/**` — matches all files underneath the /resources/ path, including /resources/image.png and /resources/css/spring.css
-   `/resources/{*path}` — matches all files underneath the /resources/ path and captures their relative path in a variable named "path"; /resources/image.png will match with "spring" -> "/image.png", and /resources/css/spring.css will match with "spring" -> "/css/spring.css"
-   `/resources/{filename:\w+}.dat` — matches /resources/spring.dat and assign the value "spring" to the filename variable
