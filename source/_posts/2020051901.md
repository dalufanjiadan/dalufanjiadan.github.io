sh (or the Shell Command Language) is a programming language described by the POSIX standard. It has many implementations (ksh88, dash, ...). bash can also be considered an implementation of sh (see below).

Because sh is a specification, not an implementation, /bin/sh is a symlink (or a hard link) to an actual implementation on most POSIX systems.
